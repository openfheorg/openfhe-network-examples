Dec 2023: OpenFHE Network Examples -- pre-release 

* Please read the [Read me file](README.md) as there is a lot of material in this respositry.

* This is currently in pre-release, while we are in the process of
  reviewing and hardening each demosntration (such as adding additonal
  error checks and clarifying installation and demo run
  instructions). For each example and demonstration we list if the
  code has been verified as operational (due to changing repostiory
  locations).
